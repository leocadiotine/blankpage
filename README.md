#Blank Page

Ever wanted a simple blank page to write notes in?

Blank Page is the simplest note-taking app ever. If you don't need synchronization, priority, ordering or due dates, and you just need a sheet of paper to quickly write a piece of information, it's for you.

If for some reason you want to save the notes, you can share them to a 3rd party app - like GMail. Can't be more simple than that.
